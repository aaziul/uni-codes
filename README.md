Repository containing code developed throughout my Computer Science degree.  
**[Repository updates in progress]**

## Racket
Used in the course *Fundamentals of Algorithms*, the Racket language was implemented using the DrRacket application and its official documentation ([https://docs.racket-lang.org/](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)) for reference and clarification. Support from classmates and professors was also essential.

## C Language
Used in the courses *Algorithms and Programming* and *Data Structures*, code was written in the Code::Blocks and VSCode development environments. Questions were resolved through online research and assistance from professors and classmates.

## GTC
This folder contains some challenges solved through Beecrowd Academic, related to Combinatorics and Graph Theory topics.

## DCS
This folder contains lab activities developed during the *Data Classification and Search* course, along with extra challenges from Beecrowd.

## TC
This folder includes code developed during the *Theory of Computation* course, involving Norma Machine, Lambda Calculus, and Turing Machine.

## DB
This folder includes SQL labs from the *Database Fundamentals* course, tested using PostgreSQL.

## Assembly
This folder contains Assembly language code developed for the *Computer Architecture I* course. Projects and exercises were written to explore low-level operations, using instruction sets and addressing modes studied throughout the semester.
