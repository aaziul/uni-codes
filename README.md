Repository containing code developed throughout my Computer Science degree.  
**[Repository updates in progress]**

## Racket
Used in the course [*Fundamentals of Algorithms*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/fundamentos-de-algoritmos), the Racket language was implemented using the DrRacket application and its official documentation ([https://docs.racket-lang.org/](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)) for reference and clarification. Support from classmates and professors was also essential.

## C Language
Used in the courses [*Algorithms and Programming*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/algoritmos-programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o) and [*Data Structures*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/estrutura-de-dados), code was written in the Code::Blocks and VSCode development environments. Questions were resolved through online research and assistance from professors and classmates.

## Combinatorics and Graph Theory
This folder contains some challenges solved through Beecrowd Academic, related to [Combinatorics and Graph Theory](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/grafos-e-analise-combinatoria) topics.

## Data Classification and Search
This folder contains lab activities developed during the [*Data Classification and Search*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/cpd) course, along with extra challenges from Beecrowd.

## Theory of Computation
This folder includes code developed during the [*Theory of Computation*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/teocomp) course, involving Norma Machine, Lambda Calculus, and Turing Machine.

## Database Fundamentals
This folder includes SQL labs from the [*Database Fundamentals*](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/fbd) course, tested using PostgreSQL.

## Assembly
This folder contains [Assembly](https://github.com/aaziul/uni-codes/tree/main/assembly) language code developed for the *Computer Architecture I* course. Projects and exercises were written to explore low-level operations, using instruction sets and addressing modes studied throughout the semester.
